# Theme

On this document, you will find all our Design Tokens. By using Design Tokens,
we can achieve creating a consistent design, and easily switching between dark
and light mode.

## Typography

While there is a `Text` component that comes with pre-defined text styles, you
can still leverage this typography-related tokens to create more complex
elements, or overwrite properties on the pre-defined text styles.

## Colors

There is two types of colors: **color palette** and **semantic colors**. The
color palette defines the color value, and a semtic color is a relation of a
color within the color palette.

While the color palette is the same between dark and light theme, the semantic
color value changes depending on the theme, and can point to a different color
of the color palette.
